world common law true sense right individual liberty hope prove one step far somebody chinese origin say country used good place migrate start new life whilst life wasnt perfect could make better riddled red tape told cannot politicallycorrect allowed belief opinion prime minister spends much time meddling u politics affair little life british citizen home abroad mr forsyth done good job voicing opinion let hope bbc doesnt get gagged letting people express view people right know bbcs role inform educate entertain agree terrorist intend spread fear reality government spread fear

worrying enthusiasm mr blair government authoritarian reaction attempt manipulate electorate fear government way id card tracking totalitarianism matter little whether give terrorist demand lost precious freedom bush blair constantly tell u seek bring others agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth shocked ease government prepared wipe major portion liberty british people enjoyed century right

people london underground could little stop terrorist potentially deadly come new tougher response little late day people outside london wake one morning find london nuked wont much society left debate he correct say mind seem forgotten disgraceful internment policy northern ireland probably caused many idealistic misguided young catholic join ira administrative detention muslim could similar effect surely public would better protected security service rather alerting suspect terrorist placing house arrest longthey place suspect terrorist surveillance maybe acquire sufficient evidence prosecute even better prevent terrorist attack dont usually much time mr forsyths largely right wing view time got spot doubt terrorist organisation would like harm uk doubtful whether alqaeda global organisation coordinating rise surveillance camera id card plan charge road use tracking every vehicle time stuff nightmare add new legislation effectively mean protection law removed anyone whim home secretary genuinely wonder sort world two child inherit end stand terrorist need attack uk government soon people terrorised could achieve bomb mr forsyth expressed exactly gut fear reservation proposed legislation could verbalise thank mr forsyth seems forget killing trouble occurred side religious divide carried killer side also forgets basic human right suspended experienced judge sat greatest miscarriage justice time little return maximum alienation law emphasis islamic threat forsyth wrong nature current threat new longer armed force soviet threat eastern bloc terrorist aim kill indiscriminately best comparison therefore blitz 1941 time let u forget suspect foreign british routinely rounded interned duration war without complaint public must forget war id say likelihood attack sleeper cell fundamentalist lunatic major uk target probability ill bet money like day attack freddie forsyth saying government didnt enough protect uk people like forsyth see one side argument side opposite new labour tony blair agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth reason country wonderful place live attack terrorist government perpetuation perceived terrorist threat alleged terrorist government believe government least highly questionable worst sinister point feel enough control every single person british isle tagged monitored constantly freedom craftily surreptitiously whittled away government gaining nothing great concern everyone slightly older mr forsyth therefore lived history police state would like think lived one think attack iraq made international situation worse may provoked act terrorism true extremely worrying parallel britain germany 30 never thought would easy take country within mr forsyth forgotten one key point terrorist threaten britain today well aware hitler stalin ira failed result modern day terrorist willing thing predecessor mean civil liberty modern britain must eroded counter threat always absolute last resort meet new threat defeat sinister fanaticism today terrorist may need thing little differently let u hope frederic forsythes comment seem wellthoughtout analysis human society whole britain particular resist temptation overprotect fear fear enables terrorist succeed end terrorist come form mr forsythes opening comment suggest reminded quote attributed thomas jefferson nation limit freedom name security neither government faced incredibly difficult task made policy deal well criticising policy mr forsythe cant draw year experience offer alternative say opinion frederick forsyths rhetoric absurd conclusion laughable distorts reality serve prejudice new labour government seek balance protection democracy minimum loss civil right frederick forsyth extremist appreciate need balance rarely find agreeing forsyth instance think correct rule law must prevail civil liberty worth defending government hold suspect without charge trial whats next agree absolutely introducing fascist type law loose moral high ground fight terror democratic system perfect churchill point better others tried terrorist attack take place many reason take personal risk return personal freedom usually agree mr forsyth spot single biggest threat face government dedicated acting illegally manipulating international national law suit purpose totalitarianism always requires outside threat justifying range extraordinary power leader want british government far greater threat terrorist organisation although principle agree frederick forsyth fails address one key point alqaeda attack though obviously none yet uk seek kill maximum number people ira wanted limit death toll attack maintain support among republican movement yes agree mr forsyths view believe government plan justified reaction negative influence u president interpretation democracy freedom us argument current wwii war liberate iraq afghanistan syria iran come leaving poor inheritance future generation mr forsyth wonderful writer keep fiction belongs british government going road mr forsyth suggests sadly comment make lot people believe governed people fast becoming tyrant instead genuinely committed stopping tyranny even method employed moment alien british people lived democracy protected tony blair others like mind mr forsyth seems putting along side scruffy little austrian thomas hobbes would smiling grave labour proposition like new labour called libertarian like new labour believed promoting people best interest forsythe criticises government hobbes criticised subsequent philosopher arguing way hand totalitarian simply put argued favour ultimate liberty liberty live man prepared surrender liberty supreme sovereign protection fellow barbaric man hobbes roundly condemned posterity rightly hope new labour suffers treatment agree mr forsyths view government approach totally spirit british democracy must allowed get away course frederick wrong britain winning war ira he wrong country becoming tyranny forgotten shoot kill torture internment without trial collusion loyalist death squad etc background somewhat similar freddies persuaded agree many sentiment moral justification imposing system government anyone systematically depriving citizen basic individual collective freedom whilst principle keeping potential terrorist house arrest might seem superficially attractive unfortunately also first step towards totalitarianism decide suspect believe faith honesty integrity competence intelligence service politician light event recent year stop false denunciation falsely accused lose career support family child still go school smack method nazi germany stalin russia ceausescus romania list go look new dark age coming see opinion mr forsyths remark divided problem see support imprisonment without trial believe never happen family people dont like scared history shown law like always get abused power today may scared people power someday power may scared day youll one imprisoned without chance justice law cannot imprisoned whim police force shown deserving imprison people without trial indeterminate period better fighting never thought possible agree single word uttered frederick forsyth im wholehearted agreement one nation grave danger duped pro u propaganda course also mean well inherit total paranoia allow government political persuasion incidentally gradually insidiously impose police state well tried tested back door method grieve future child wonder theyre adamant dont ever want government much fanfare sign u european convention human right want introduce indefinite house arrest without trial put par government burma like many respondent wouldnt usually think mr forsyth someone whose view share instance opposing charles clark proposal house arrest agree wholeheartedly mr forsyth agree mr forsyth look fact government along u invaded another sovereign country iraq selecting intelligence backed case based fear fact turned different individual treated distorted way weve done damage terrorist organisation could bomb become animal agree many way mr forsyth said respected influence within world must seen walking walk well talking talk accuse country zimbabwe burma human right abuse locking people may totally innocent hypocrisy highest order mr forsyth link islamic fundamentalism new threat however appears misunderstood term islamic fundamentalism pointed muslim adheres true fundamental quraan teaching last prophet muhammad islamic fundamentalist person commit suicide shape form shehe kill innocent woman men child person selfreflective constantly try better herhis action good others people mr forsyth label new threat follow correct teaching islam arrived interpretation assumption regard action top claim following islam true form accept intention policy make britain safer place cannot think single example history sort thing ever made difference northern ireland internment certainly didnt achieve anything bombing didnt stop could argued achieved supply ira yet angry resentful republican willing take arm british eight year older frederick forsyth survivor blitz london easy agree absolutely spot ira bombing massive explosion canary wharf right write also left city london notwithstanding attempted nearly successful assassination attempt prime minister thatcher brighton later occupant 10 downing street retaliatory blitz belfast dublin afghanistan iraq even england true peril 1940 apart detention wholesale derogation habeas corpus like see latest attempt liberty including id card winston churchill decided go since said average bobby beat could relied tempted take undue advantage citizen going lawful activity incidentally still remember old id card number hence clear far great police state power set statute book resisted neutered
